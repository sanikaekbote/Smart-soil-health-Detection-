Setup and Installation Process


1. Circuit Assembly: Connect all sensors to ESP32 following the circuit diagram. Relay controls the water pump.
2. Power Source: 12V battery.
3. Mounting: Place sensors at root-level depth in the soil. Position ESP32 and relay in a waterproof enclosure.
4. Programming: Flash the ESP32 with Arduino IDE using the custom code.
                Flash the Arduino uno with Arduino IDE using the custom code.

5. Connectivity: Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi for cloud and app integration (ThingSpeak/Blynk/App).
6. Mobile App Configuration: Add device ID and configure thresholds in the app dashboard.
